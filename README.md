## User Story:
AS A student preparing my meal  
I WANT to be able to substitute an ingredient I do not have   
SO THAT I can still cook a meal without the missing ingredient  

## Acceptance Criteria:
GIVEN A search input   
WHEN I search for an ingredient and choose from the dropdown how many recipe options to display  
THEN I am presented with a list of ingredients and a link to the recipe   
WHEN I want to substitue an ingredient on the ingredient list  
THEN I can click the substitute button on the ingredients card and a dropdown menu of the ingredient will display and I can click on the ingredient I  want to substitute and a modal will pop up with a list of alternative ingredient  
WHEN I am done viewing the modal, I can exit by clicking on the x on the top right corner  
THEN if I like the receipe, I can click the save button  
WHEN I refresh the page  
THEN my previously saved recipes will be saved in the Saved Recipes drop-down in the top right corner of the page
